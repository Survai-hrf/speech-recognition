Let's see if you can see it or not. Exclusively, the panorama. In the middle of the rain, this situation is developing. There were protesters who were concentrated exclusively on the Nezuaico bridge. And from there they have withdrawn. They enter in front of a hill. Which is also part of the airport. And well, the police is advancing little by little. And well, the protesters have also been completely dissolved. And there is a picket. Here there is a police picket that prevents the passage of the protesters. So that they cannot enter or concentrate in that area exclusively. We are back in this broadcast because we have had some problems with the internet. However, the situation has already calmed down for the moment. And well, we have not been able to have information that some kind of injured have been registered. In this last confrontation. However, we can notice that an hour ago there were also confrontations between the police and the protesters. Where he left a balance of four injured people in the protesters. And as for the police, according to the RPP, we were listening and it was said that there were two injured policemen. That after a confrontation. Now in this last confrontation that we have been able to record in moments. We have no information if there is an incident like the previous one. That is, there are injured people or people who have lost their lives. However, this situation has already calmed down for the moment. And well, let's hope that this situation calms down as soon as possible. In this way, the authorities also listen to the request of the protesters. To avoid any kind of confrontations that are coming to extremes. And I also hope that many people will go out into the streets. There is the police, they are covering the airport. And well, around we were also walking and there was an attempt to take the facilities of the Rotrigez-Valló airport. And at that time it has not been possible to achieve it. Since the police have used forces to disperse the protesters and avoid them. Here in this area. Well friends, with this we say goodbye and we will return with more information.
